This version, 0.1.1, contains changes for rlang 0.3.0 compatibility.
There are no other changes.

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.5.1
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.2 - 3.5
* win-builder (devel and release)
* rhub:
    - Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS, R-release, GCC


On win-builder I get a note concerning a link to codecov in README.md.
This is a GitHub badge and works correctly there.

Otherwise, the tests passes.
